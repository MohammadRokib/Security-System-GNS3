### Security System for a Topology built in GNS3

Assalamu Alaikum everyone,
In this project We have built a security system on a topology/network inside GNS3 to prevent it from Cyber attack such as **SQL Injection** and so on.

Now a days all Website, Apps we use by connecting to the internet are vulnerable to many cyber attacks. As a result all our public and private data going in the wrong hands. Data breach like these can cause many problems to us. So to prevent problem like these we need to secure the we have to take some masures.

So we have built a topology consists of 4 routers which contains their own networks consists of one switch and a PC. One of the PC is acting as a Web Server.
